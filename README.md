# Implement-Caesar-Cipher

## Description

This project provides a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of a message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages interactively.

## Features

- Encrypts text using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts encrypted text back to its original form.
- Customizable shift value.

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the text by a fixed number of positions (the "shift value"). 

For example:

Original Text: HELLO
Shift Value: 3
Encrypted Text: KHOOR
To decrypt, the letters are shifted back by the same value.

## Run the program:

python caesar_cipher.py

## Follow the prompts to:

Encrypt a message

Decrypt a message
